# My Submission for the Udacity Cloud Native Program

## UdaConnect

This implements a small MVP based on a microservice architecture:

![image](docs/architecture_design.png)

It is refactored from a monolithic design, furthermore the protocols have been revisted to facilitate the best service.

### Environment Setup
To run the application, you will need a K8s cluster running locally and to interface with it via `kubectl`. We will be using Vagrant with VirtualBox to run K3s.

#### Initialize K3s
In this project's root, run `vagrant up`.
```bash
$ vagrant up
```
The command will take a while and will leverage VirtualBox to load an [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) OS and automatically install [K3s](https://k3s.io/). When we are taking a break from development, we can run `vagrant suspend` to conserve some ouf our system's resources and `vagrant resume` when we want to bring our resources back up. Some useful vagrant commands can be found in [this cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/wpscholar/a49594e2e2b918f4d0c4).

#### Set up `kubectl`
After `vagrant up` is done, you will SSH into the Vagrant environment and retrieve the Kubernetes config file used by `kubectl`. We want to copy the contents of this file into our local environment so that `kubectl` knows how to communicate with the K3s cluster.
```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```
You will now be connected inside of the virtual OS. Run `sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to print out the contents of the file. You should see output similar to the one that I've shown below. Note that the output below is just for your reference: every configuration is unique and you should _NOT_ copy the output I have below.

Copy the contents from the output issued from your own command into your clipboard -- we will be pasting it somewhere soon!
```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

Type `exit` to exit the virtual OS and you will find yourself back in your computer's session. Create the file (or replace if it already exists) `~/.kube/config` and paste the contents of the `k3s.yaml` output here.

Afterwards, you can test that `kubectl` works by running a command like `kubectl describe services`. It should not return any errors.

### Steps
1. `kubectl apply -f deployment/db-configmap.yaml` - Set up environment variables for the pods
2. `kubectl apply -f deployment/db-secret.yaml` - Set up secrets for the pods
3. `kubectl apply -f deployment/postgres.yaml` - Set up a Postgres database running PostGIS
4. `kubectl apply -f deployment/uda2-con-servie-api.yml` - API for connections
5. `kubectl apply -f deployment/person-api.yaml` - API for persons
6. `kubectl apply -f deployment/frontend-app.yaml` - Frontend
7. `kubectl apply -f deployment/kafka.yml` - kafka

WAIT. I noticed it takes a while till we can reach Kafka

8. `kubectl apply -f deployment/loc-consumer.yml` - start the consumer to update db
9. `kubectl apply -f deployment/loc-producer.yml` - start the producer to update kafka

Optional: `sh scripts/run_db_command.sh <POD_NAME>` - Seed your database against the `postgres` pod. (`kubectl get pods` will give you the `POD_NAME`)

Manually applying each of the individual `yaml` files is cumbersome but going through each step provides some context on the content of the starter project. In practice, we would have reduced the number of steps by running the command against a directory to apply of the contents: `kubectl apply -f deployment/`.
